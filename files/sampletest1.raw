High-dose
growth
hormone
does
not
affect
proinflammatory
cytokine
(
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
,
interleukin-6
,
and
interferon-gamma
)
release
from
activated
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
or
after
minimal
to
moderate
surgical
stress
.

High-dose
GH
therapy
,
with
GH
doses
10-20
times
the
normal
replacement
dose
for
GH-deficient
adults
,
has
been
used
as
an
anti-catabolic
agent
in
a
number
of
different
patient
groups
.

A
recent
study
,
however
,
has
shown
an
increase
in
mortality
in
critically
ill
patients
treated
with
high-dose
GH
.

The
increased
mortality
was
associated
with
multiorgan
failure
,
septic
shock
,
and
uncontrolled
infection
,
suggesting
that
GH
may
have
altered
the
immune
response
.

The
GH
receptor
and
GH
are
both
expressed
in
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMCs
)
;
thus
,
GH
could
act
as
either
an
endocrine
or
an
autocrine
modulator
of
the
immune
response
.

We
have
examined
the
hypothesis
that
high-dose
GH
therapy
may
induce
proinflammatory
cytokines
,
which
are
implicated
in
septic
shock
.

To
do
this
we
measured
cytokine
production
by
PBMCs
incubated
in
conditions
that
simulated
high-dose
GH
therapy
,
and
we
measured
cytokine
levels
in
patients
undergoing
laparoscopic
cholecystectomy
who
were
randomized
to
receive
either
high-dose
GH
therapy
(
13
IU/m2
x
day
)
or
placebo
.

To
confirm
the
biological
activity
of
GH
in
our
cell
culture
system
we
used
a
Stat5
functional
assay
.

In
this
assay
GH
induced
a
bell-shaped
curve
,
with
a
maximal
response
at
GH
levels
between
100-1
,
000
ng/mL
.

PBMCs
from
healthy
volunteers
were
incubated
with
GH
in
doses
from
1-1
,
000
ng/mL
for
6-72
h
under
resting
conditions
and
after
activation
with
endotoxin
and
the
mixed
lymphocyte
reaction
.

Studies
were
repeated
with
PBMCs
from
six
individuals
using
a
GH
dose
of
100
ng/mL
(
the
level
of
GH
found
after
high-dose
GH
therapy
)
and
an
endotoxin
dose
that
gave
a
submaximal
response
(
0.01
ng/mL
)
.

GH
had
no
effect
on
cell
proliferation
or
the
production
of
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
(
TNFalpha
)
,
interleukin-6
(
IL-6
)
,
or
interferon-gamma
(
IFNgamma
)
.

In
patients
undergoing
laparoscopic
cholecystectomy
there
was
a
time-related
effect
of
surgery
on
cytokine
levels
.

There
was
a
rise
in
IL-6
and
a
fall
in
TNFalpha
at
24
h
after
surgery
;
however
,
high-dose
GH
therapy
had
no
effect
on
the
cytokine
response
.

We
considered
the
possibility
that
endogenous
GH
production
by
PBMCs
could
influence
the
cytokine
response
in
activated
PBMCs
;
however
,
incubation
of
PBMCs
in
the
presence
of
the
GH
receptor
antagonist
,
B2036
,
had
no
effect
on
TNFalpha
,
IL-6
,
or
IFNgamma
production
by
PBMCs
in
either
the
mixed
lymphocyte
reaction
or
when
activated
by
endotoxin
.

These
results
suggest
that
high-dose
GH
therapy
does
not
alter
the
proinflammatory
cytokine
response
to
surgery
or
endotoxin
.

The
results
do
not
exclude
an
effect
of
GH
on
the
immune
response
,
but
they
suggest
that
the
mortality
seen
in
critically
ill
patients
may
be
due
to
factors
other
than
immune
modulation
.

Interaction
between
interferon
consensus
sequence-binding
protein
and
COP9/signalosome
subunit
CSN2
(
Trip15
)
.

A
possible
link
between
interferon
regulatory
factor
signaling
and
the
COP9/signalosome
.

Interferon
consensus
sequence-binding
protein
(
ICSBP
)
is
a
member
of
the
interferon
regulatory
factors
(
IRF
)
that
has
a
pivotal
role
in
mediating
resistance
to
pathogenic
infections
in
mice
and
in
promoting
the
differentiation
of
myeloid
cells
.

ICSBP
exerts
some
of
its
transcriptional
activities
via
association
with
other
factors
that
enable
its
binding
to
a
variety
of
promoters
containing
DNA
composite
elements
.

These
interactions
are
mediated
through
a
specific
COOH-terminal
domain
termed
IAD
(
IRF
association
domain
)
.

To
gain
a
broader
insight
of
the
capacity
of
ICSBP
to
interact
with
other
factors
,
yeast
two-hybrid
screens
were
performed
using
ICSBP-IAD
as
a
bait
against
a
B-cell
cDNA
library
.

Trip15
was
identified
as
a
specific
interacting
factor
with
ICSBP
in
yeast
cells
,
which
was
also
confirmed
by
in
vitro
glutathione
S-transferase
pull-down
assays
and
by
coimmunoprecipitation
studies
in
COS7
cells
.

Trip15
was
recently
identified
as
a
component
of
the
COP9/signalosome
(
CSN
)
complex
composed
of
eight
evolutionary
conserved
subunits
and
thus
termed
CSN2
.

This
complex
has
a
role
in
cell-signaling
processes
,
which
is
manifested
by
its
associated
novel
kinase
activity
and
by
the
involvement
of
its
subunits
in
regulating
multiple
cell-signaling
pathways
and
cell-cycle
progression
.

We
show
that
in
vitro
association
of
ICSBP
with
the
CSN
leads
to
phosphorylation
of
ICSBP
at
a
unique
serine
residue
within
its
IAD
.

The
phosphorylated
residue
is
essential
for
efficient
association
with
IRF-1
and
thus
for
the
repressor
activity
of
ICSBP
exerted
on
IRF-1
.

This
suggests
that
the
CSN
has
a
role
in
integrating
incoming
signals
that
affect
the
transcriptional
activity
of
ICSBP
.

Intrathymic
T
cell
development
and
selection
proceeds
normally
in
the
absence
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
signaling
.

Glucocorticoids
are
believed
to
play
a
role
in
T
cell
development
and
selection
,
although
their
precise
function
is
controversial
.

Glucocorticoid
receptor
(
GR
)
-deficient
mice
were
used
to
directly
investigate
this
problem
.

GR-deficient
thymocytes
were
resistant
to
dexamethasone-mediated
apoptosis
,
confirming
the
absence
of
glucocorticoid
responsiveness
.

An
absence
of
GR
signaling
had
no
impact
on
thymocyte
development
either
in
vivo
or
in
vitro
.

T
cell
differentiation
,
including
positive
selection
,
was
normal
as
assessed
by
normal
development
of
CD4+CD8+
,
alphabetaTCR+CD4+
,
and
alphabetaTCR+CD8+
thymocytes
.

Negative
selection
,
mediated
by
the
superantigen
staphylococcal
enterotoxin
B
(
SEB
)
,
or
anti-CD3/CD28
,
was
also
normal
in
the
absence
of
GR
signaling
.

In
contrast
to
earlier
reports
,
these
data
demonstrate
that
GR
signaling
is
not
essential
for
intrathymic
T
cell
development
or
selection
.

Rapid
polarization
of
Th2
cells
during
induction
of
antigen-specific
IgE
antibodies
in
vitro
.

BACKGROUND
:
Type
2
T-helper
cells
(
Th2
)
are
involved
in
the
regulation
of
the
humoral
immune
response
against
antigens
and
allergens
and
directly
affect
which
isotype
will
be
produced
.

The
mechanism
that
regulates
antigen-specific
IgE
secretion
and
immune
deviation
is
still
not
known
.

OBJECTIVES
:
To
delineate
mechanisms
behind
antigen-specific
IgE
secretion
we
have
used
in
vitro
immunization
and
focused
on
T-cell
phenotype
and
the
activation
status
of
the
transcription
factor
NFkappaB
.

METHODS
:
Peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
(
PBMC
)
from
seronegative
donors
were
immunized
in
vitro
with
a
peptide
consisting
of
both
a
T-cell
and
a
B-cell
epitope
.

RESULTS
:
Antigen-specific
IgE
antibodies
could
be
detected
after
a
primary
immunization
,
during
which
T-helper
cells
secreted
type
2
cytokines
.

Specific
IgE
was
also
detected
in
the
secondary
immunization
,
but
due
to
a
rapid
polarization
from
Th2
to
Th1
phenotype
,
exogenous
IL-4
was
required
for
the
specific
IgE
secretion
.

Analysis
of
NFkappaB
activation
in
B
and
T
cells
during
primary
and
secondary
immunization
showed
that
NFkappaB
could
be
detected
in
both
B
and
T
cells
during
primary
immunization
,
but
was
dependent
on
exogenous
IL-4
in
the
secondary
immunization
.

CONCLUSION
:
This
is
the
first
evidence
of
antigen-specific
IgE
induction
in
vitro
using
naive
B
cells
,
demonstrating
the
involvement
of
T-helper
cell
phenotype
and
NFkappaB
and
demonstrates
the
usefulness
of
in
vitro
cultures
to
study
the
effect
of
antigens
on
human
immunocytes
.

Pulmonary

and
increased
Th-2
cytokine
expression
and
nuclear
factor
kB
activation
in
the
lung
after
sensitization
and
allergen
challenge
in
brown
Norway
rats
.

BACKGROUND
:
Our
purpose
was
to
evaluate
the
expression
of
Th-1
and
Th-2
related
cytokine
mRNA
and
nuclear
factor
(
NF
)
kB
in
the
lung
tissue
of
ovalbumin
(
OA
)
sensitized
brown
Norway
rats
(
BNR
)
.

We
also
evaluated
the
correlation
between
bronchial
hyperreactivity
(
BHR
)
and
eosinophils
with
cytokine
mRNA
expression
.

METHODS
:
Eight
BNR
(
weight
range
250-350
g
)
were
sensitized
by
inhaled
OA
(
group
I
)
with
a
1-week
interval
between
and
then
provoked
with
OA
1
week
later
.

Pulmonary
function
tests
(
PFT
)
were
performed
at
baseline
and
24
h
after
acetylcholine
challenge
.

Eight
weight-matched
normal
BNR
served
as
controls
(
group
II
)
.

All
animals
were
anesthetized
,
paralyzed
with
gallamine
,
and
ventilated
via
tracheostomy
.

They
were
given
varying
doses
of
acetylcholine
(
25
,
50
,
75
,
100
microg/kg
)
injected
through
a
jugular
venous
catheter
.

Five
seconds
after
acetylcholine
injections
,
PFTs
were
performed
,
including
a
maximal
forced
expiratory
maneuver
(
MFEM
)
,
airway
opening
pressure
(
P
(
ao
)
)
at
tidal
breathing
and
total
dynamic
lung
compliance
(
C
(
dyn
)
)
.

Bronchoalveolar
lavage
(
BAL
)
was
then
performed
with
20
ml
normal
saline
divided
into
two
doses
.

Thereafter
,
the
lungs
were
removed
and
examined
histologically
.

Total
RNA
was
extracted
from
lung
tissue
samples
and
reverse-transcriptase
polymerase
chain
reaction
was
performed
using
primers
for
mRNA
of
IL-4
,
IL-5
,
IL-10
,
interferon-gamma
(
IFNr
)
and
beta-actine
.

RESULTS
:
Group
I
OA
treated
rats
had
typical
airway
obstruction
on
PFTs
and
airway
inflammation
on
histological
examination
.

Ratios
of
IL-4
,
IL-5
,
IL-10
and
inducible
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
iNOS
)
mRNA
levels
to
beta-actine
as
measured
by
densitometry
were
significantly
lower
in
controls
than
in
OA-sensitized
rats
.

The
IFNr
mRNA
to
beta-actin
ratio
was
significantly
reduced
in
OA-sensitized
rats
.

Group
I
demonstrated
a
band
shift
when
compared
with
group
II
in
electromobility
shift
assay
(
EMSA
)
for
NF-kB
indicating
increased
activation
of
this
transcription
factor
.

CONCLUSION
:
Th-2
related
cytokine
mRNA
was
increased
but
Th-1
related
cytokine
mRNA
was
decreased
in
OA-sensitized
BNR
.

An
increased
level
of
Th-2
related
cytokine
mRNA
correlated
with
decreased
airflow
and
inflammatory
changes
.

These
results
demonstrate
the
value
of
the
BNR
model
for
studying
allergic
asthma
at
the
molecular
level
.

3
,
5-Bis
(
trifluoromethyl
)
pyrazoles
:
a
novel
class
of
NFAT
transcription
factor
regulator
.

A
series
of
bis
(
trifluoromethyl
)
pyrazoles
(
BTPs
)
has
been
found
to
be
a
novel
inhibitor
of
cytokine
production
.

Identified
initially
as
inhibitors
of
IL-2
synthesis
,
the
BTPs
have
been
optimized
in
this
regard
and
even
inhibit
IL-2
production
with
a
10-fold
enhancement
over
cyclosporine
in
an
ex
vivo
assay
.

Additionally
,
the
BTPs
show
inhibition
of
IL-4
,
IL-5
,
IL-8
,
and
eotaxin
production
.

Unlike
the
IL-2
inhibitors
,
cyclosporine
and
FK506
,
the
BTPs
do
not
directly
inhibit
the
dephosphorylation
of
NFAT
by
calcineurin
.

A
repression-derepression
mechanism
regulating
the
transcription
of
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
in
primary
T
cells
.

BACKGROUND
:
Despite
some
controversy
regarding
the
preferential
infection
and
replication
of
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
(
HIV-1
)
,
it
appears
that
primary
T
lymphocytes
,
in
their
quiescent
state
,
are
nonpermissive
for
viral
expression
and
propagation
.

Massive
activation
of
viral
gene
expression
occurs
only
when
the
host
lymphocyte
is
activated
.

These
observations
prompted
us
to
investigate
the
transcriptional
regulation
of
HIV-1
in
resting
or
activated
T
cells
that
were
isolated
from
cord
blood
or
adult
peripheral
blood
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
To
this
end
,
we
employed
cellular
purification
and
phenotyping
techniques
,
in
vitro
protein-DNA
binding
studies
,
functional
transactivation
assays
using
proteins
isolated
from
cord
blood
or
adult
peripheral
blood
T
lymphocytes
,
and
transfection
experiments
in
primary
T
cells
.

RESULTS
:
We
showed
that
transcription
from
the
HIV-1
long
terminal
repeat
is
repressed
in
resting
naive
T
lymphocytes
;
whereas
,
mitogenically
stimulated
CD4+
cells
form
an
activator
that
derepresses
transcription
.

Negative
and
positive
regulation
act
through
a
repressor-activator
target
sequence
(
RATS
)
,
which
shares
homology
with
the
interleukin-2
(
IL-2
)
purine-rich
response
element
,
through
the
adjacent
binding
site
of
the
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
(
NFAT
)
,
and
weakly
,
through
the
KB
region
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
This
regulation
exerted
by
cellular
transcription
factors
can
account
for
several
important
features
of
HIV-1
expression
in
primary
CD4+
cells
.

Tight
repression
in
resting
naive
T
helper
cells
may
be
a
main
cause
of
viral
latency
and
transcriptional
activation
accounts
for
massive
viral
production
in
activated
T
lymphocytes
.

Involvement
of
lipopolysaccharide
binding
protein
,
CD14
,
and
Toll-like
receptors
in
the
initiation
of
innate
immune
responses
by
Treponema
glycolipids
.

Culture
supernatants
from
Treponema
maltophilum
associated
with
periodontitis
in
humans
and
Treponema
brennaborense
found
in
a
bovine
cattle
disease
accompanied
with
cachexia
caused
a
dose-dependent
TNF-alpha
synthesis
in
human
monocytes
increasing
with
culture
time
.

This
activity
could
be
reduced
significantly
by
blocking
the
CD14
-part
of
the
LPS
receptor
using
the
My
4
mAb
and
by
polymyxin
B
.

In
the
murine
macrophage
cell
line
RAW
264.7
,
Treponema
culture
supernatants
induced
TNF-alpha
secretion
in
a
LPS
binding
protein
(
LBP
)
-dependent
fashion
.

To
enrich
for
active
compounds
,
supernatants
were
extracted
with
butanol
,
while
whole
cells
were
extracted
using
a
phenol/water
method
resulting
in
recovery
of
material
exhibiting
a
similar
activity
profile
.

An
LPS-LBP
binding
competition
assay
revealed
an
interaction
of
the
treponeme
phenol/water
extracts
with
LBP
,
while
precipitation
studies
implied
an
affinity
to
polymyxin
B
and
endotoxin
neutralizing
protein
.

Macrophages
obtained
from
C3H/HeJ
mice
carrying
a
Toll-like
receptor
(
TLR
)
-4
mutation
were
stimulated
with
treponeme
extracts
for
NO
release
to
assess
the
role
of
TLRs
in
cell
activation
.

Furthermore
,
NF-kappaB
translocation
in
TLR-2-negative
Chinese
hamster
ovary
(
CHO
)
cells
was
studied
.

We
found
that
phenol/water-extracts
of
the
two
strains
use
TLRs
differently
with
T.
brennaborense-stimulating
cells
in
a
TLR-4-dependent
fashion
,
while
T.
maltophilum-mediated
activation
apparently
involved
TLR-2
.

These
results
indicate
the
presence
of
a
novel
class
of
glycolipids
in
Treponema
initiating
inflammatory
responses
involving
LBP
,
CD14
,
and
TLRs
.

Integration
of
calcineurin
and
MEF2
signals
by
the
coactivator
p300
during
T-cell
apoptosis
.

T-cell
antigen
receptor
(
TCR
)
-induced
thymocyte
apoptosis
is
mediated
by
calcium-dependent
signal
transduction
pathways
leading
to
the
transcriptional
activation
of
members
of
the
Nur77
family
.

The
major
calcium-
and
calcineurin-responsive
elements
in
the
Nur77
promoter
are
binding
sites
for
myocyte
enhancer
factor-2
(
MEF2
)
.

It
has
been
shown
that
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
(
NFAT
)
interacts
with
MEF2D
and
enhances
its
transcriptional
activity
,
offering
a
plausible
mechanism
of
activation
of
MEF2D
by
calcineurin
.

We
report
here
that
NFATp
synergizes
with
MEF2D
to
recruit
the
coactivator
p300
for
the
transcription
of
Nur77
.

Surprisingly
,
the
enhancement
of
transcriptional
activity
of
MEF2D
by
NFATp
does
not
require
its
DNA-binding
activity
,
suggesting
that
NFATp
acts
as
a
coactivator
for
MEF2D
.

Transient
co-expression
of
p300
,
MEF2D
,
NFATp
and
constitutively
active
calcineurin
is
sufficient
to
recapitulate
TCR
signaling
for
the
selective
induction
of
the
endogenous
Nur77
gene
.

These
results
implicate
NFAT
as
an
important
mediator
of
T-cell
apoptosis
and
suggest
that
NFAT
is
capable
of
integrating
the
calcineurin
signaling
pathway
and
other
pathways
through
direct
protein-protein
interaction
with
other
transcription
factors
.

Induction
or
suppression
of
a
B
cell-specific
response
to
self
antigen
in
vivo
is
dependent
upon
dendritic
cell
activation
via
the
TNF-alpha
receptor
at
the
time
of
antigen
uptake
.

In
this
study
we
show
that
the
retinal
autoantigen
,
S-antigen
,
contains
a
functional
TNF-alpha
homologous
domain
which
stimulates
maturation
and
differentiation
of
cultured
dendritic
cells
(
DC
)
or
tissue
DC
via
the
p55
TNF-alpha
receptor
.

Tissue
DC
became
more
dendritiform
in
shape
,
and
migrated
into
culture
supernatant
.

S-antigen
also
stimulated
accumulation
of
cell
surface
MHC
class
II
antigen
with
a
corresponding
loss
of
acidic
intracellular
vesicles
,
and
induced
IL-1beta
and
IL-12
mRNA
expression
in
cultured
bone
marrow-derived
DC
.

In
addition
,
cultured
splenic
DC
primed
immune
responses
to
S-antigen
in
vivo
in
the
absence
of
other
,
exogenous
cytokine
sources
.

DC
pulsed
with
either
retinal
S-antigen
or
another
retinal
autoantigen
,
interphotoreceptor
retinoid
binding
protein
(
IRBP
)
,
were
able
to
stimulate
naive
T
cell
proliferation
in
vitro
,
but
only
S-antigen
-pulsed
DC
were
able
to
induce
an
immune
response
in
vivo
and
initiate
antibody
class
switching
.

In
contrast
,
IRBP
-pulsed
DC
had
no
detectable
in
vivo
priming
effect
and
IgG
antibody
levels
remained
suppressed
even
after
immunization
with
IRBP
in
complete
Freund
's
adjuvant
.

These
results
indicate
that
DC
from
the
same
precursor
population
can
either
induce
or
suppress
a
B
cell-specific
response
to
self
antigen
in
vivo
,
the
outcome
being
dependent
upon
DC
activation
at
the
time
of
antigen
uptake
